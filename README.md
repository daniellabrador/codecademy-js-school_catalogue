## Project Prompt

Letâ€™s put your knowledge of classes to the test by creating a digital school catalog for the New York City Department of Education. The Department of Education wants the catalog to hold quick reference material for each school in the city.

We need to create classes for primary and high schools. Because these classes share properties and methods, each will inherit from a parent `School` class. Our parent and three child classes have the following properties, getters, setters, and methods:

### School

- Properties: `name` (string), `level` (one of three strings: `'primary'`, `'middle'`, or `'high'`), and `numberOfStudents` (number)
- Getters: all properties have getters
- Setters: the `numberOfStudents` property has a setter
- Methods: `.quickFacts()` and `.pickSubstituteTeacher()` (this is a static method)

### Primary

- Includes everything in the `School` class, plus one additional property
- Properties: `pickupPolicy` (string)

### Middle

- Does not include any additional properties or methods

### High

- Includes everything in the `School` class, plus one additional property
- Properties: `sportsTeams` (array of strings)

## Technologies

- JavaScript (ES6)

## Setup

To run this program, you need install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to your machine.

Enter this command to the terminal:

```git
node script.js
```

You can freely add and access objects and its properties and methods, or modify current objects created directly in the `script.js` file.
